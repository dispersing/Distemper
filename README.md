Distemper code
================

This is repository for a project looking at the spread of canine distemper.  I've posted bits of R code to share with collaborators.

Here are the file descriptions:
1.  LogisitcPractice.R: introduction to using functions in R and some basic plotting
2.  NeighborhoodMat.R: following the format of KD's data, creates a matrix of Euclidian neighborhood distances
3.  PlottingPractice.R:  using the format of KD's model output, plots (1) individual and mean populations through time and (2) population sizes on a grid in space for one time.
